# One Billion Count Test

This project aims to conduct a count test of one billion using various programming languages. The purpose is to compare the performance and efficiency of counting to such a large number across different languages.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to measure and analyze the performance metrics, such as execution time, memory usage, and scalability, while performing a count test up to one billion in different programming languages.

## Testing Methodology

### Languages Included

1. **Python**
2. **Go**
3. **Dart**
4. 

### Testing Procedure

Each programming language will have its dedicated folder within this repository, containing the necessary code files to conduct the count test up to one billion. The following steps are followed for each language:

1. **Implementation:** A dedicated script will be created in each language to count up to one billion using the most optimized method available for that specific language.
   
2. **Execution:** Scripts will be executed on a test environment with standard hardware specifications, and execution time will be measured.

3. **Performance Metrics:** Performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution time, will be logged and compared across different languages.

## Results

Results of the test will be documented in this repository's Wiki section or in a dedicated report file. The comparison will include insights into the efficiency, speed, and resource consumption of each language in handling such a large count.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add additional languages or optimize existing code for better performance, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
